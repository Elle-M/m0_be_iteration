# Self Evaluation

- How confident do you feel in your understanding and fluency with the `each` method?

I understand what it does.

- This was a much more advanced concept than anything you've done in Mod 0, and the exercises required you to push yourself to apply other background knowledge or learn things outside of the curriculum - how did that feel? Did you have productive struggle? Unproductive struggle?

It took a while to get there, but it was a productive struggle. Trying, googling, patience, persistance, ect.

- What do you still need to practice or learn? How will you do that? Do you need to adjust your calendar in order to do that?

I still need to work on managing time more effectively. Today I learned just because one lesson may come easy it doesn't mean the next with. :)

- What questions do you still have? How will you get the answers you need?

I'm so tired I'm out of questions for tonight. But I am sure they will come back tomorrow.
